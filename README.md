A Brief Introduction
=======================

In this series, Iâ€™ve covered five terms for data manipulation:

    arrange
    filter
    mutate
    select
    summarise

These are the verbs that make up the grammar of data manipulation. They all work with group_by to perform these functions groupwise.

There are scoped versions of these verbs, which add _all, _if, or _at, that allow you to perform these verbs on multiple variables simultaneously. For instance, I could get means for all of my numeric variables like this. (Quick note: I created an updated reading dataset that has all publication years filled in. )
